# FOR-first-Hackathon
its my first time on participating on hackathon. I want to win this but I am running out of ideas. I thought of a software that help farmers to use sufficient amount of fertilizer in their field as farmers use more than necessary fertilizer to grow more crops. But I dropped this idea thinking if farmers was able to use different app. they can also google it. So I didn't think its a good idea that's why I dropped this idea. Currently I am thinking of making a simple WI-FI passcode changer for the 50s people as this is hard for them due to complex setting and there is no app just to change the passcode in playstore or appstore which makes the people from 50s hard to change the passcode also they forget even if we try to teach them due to complexity. So its my idea for them just changing WI-FI passcode. Thank you!
